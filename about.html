<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am slowly learning how to be a web developer again, learning my craft through classes at General Assembly and supplemental training via SoloLearn, Code Academy, Udemy and other online schools such as Hack Reactor.</p>

<h3>Goal: </h3>

<p>To have a change in careers from working 14 years as administrative assistant and phone support/customer support specialist to a web developer who works from home and helps people realize their website dreams. </p>

<p>You can contact me via my email here.</p>
